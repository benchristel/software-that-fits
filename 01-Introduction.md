This is a book about the philosophy of software development<br/>
but its goal is to get you to give up on philosophy.

This is a book about programming style<br/>
but its message is that you should abandon all style.

This book teaches a way of developing software,<br/>
but it is the Way of No Way.<br/>
It has no road, no guideposts, and no destination.<br/>

It leads nowhere, so with it, you can get anywhere.<br/>
Its iron rule is that everything is allowed.
